# Bat-Ball-Stump-Game
Project Overview:

The Bat-Ball-Stump Game is a fun and interactive web-based game that allows users to engage in a virtual version of the classic "rock-paper-scissors" style gameplay. In this game, players choose between three options: bat, ball, and stump. The computer randomly selects one of these options as well. The goal is to create an engaging and straightforward gaming experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Gameplay Rules:

The user selects one of three options: bat, ball, or stump.
The computer randomly chooses one of the three options.
The outcomes are determined as follows:
If the user chooses bat and the computer chooses ball, the user wins.
If the user chooses ball and the computer chooses stump, the user wins.
If the user chooses stump and the computer chooses bat, the user wins.
If the user and computer choose the same option, the game results in a tie .
In any other combination, the computer wins.
Technologies Used:

HTML: For the structure of the web application, including buttons for user input and areas to display the results.
CSS: To enhance the visual appeal of the game, including layout, colors, and animations.
JavaScript: To handle the game logic, including random selection for the computer and determining the winner based on the rules outlined above.

Objectives:

To develop a simple yet engaging game that demonstrates basic programming concepts.
